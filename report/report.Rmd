####**Abstract**
In this report we extend the _simple regression analysis_ from last time and try to reproduce the main results displayed in section 3.2 _Multiple Linear Regression_ of the book  **An introduction to statistical Learning **

####**Introduction**
The goal is to extend the analysis of advertising data to see, besides TV, if other two medias newspaper and radio have an effect on the sales of a particular product. And if so, develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of three media budgets. 

####**Data**
The Advertising data set consists of the **Sales** (in thousands of units) of a particular product in 200 different
markets, along with advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for the product in each of those markets for
three different media: **TV,** **Radio**, and **Newspaper**.

####**Methodology**
The multiple linear regression model gives each predictor a separate slope coefficient in a single model:
       _Sales_=
 To estimate each coefficient we fit a regression model via the least square criterion.  For RSE, R squared and F-statistics we used the formulas in the book to carry computation.
  
####**Results**
The simple linear regression model for each media is shown in the tables below:


Coefficient estimates of the least squares model is shown below:


Correlation matrix of three medias and sales is summarized in the table below:

Lastly, RSE, R square and F-statistic of the least square model is summarized in the table below:


Answers to additional questions:
1. By looking at F-statistic, we can see if there's relationship between the response and predictors. Since the F-statistics from multiple regression model is 570>1, it means that at least one of the media is related to the sale
2. Only a subset of predictors are helpful
3. Combining R square, RSE and p-value, we conclude that a model that uses TV and radio expenditures to
predict sales is substantially better than one that uses only TV advertising. Adding newspaper almost have no effects on the product sales
4. We would use both 95% confidence interval and prediction interval to quantify the uncertainty.  The prediction
interval is substantially wider than the confidence interval, reflecting the increased uncertainty about sales for a given city in comparison to the average sales over many locations.

####**Conclusions**
In conclusion,  we used multiple regression models to visualize the relationship between  three advertising medias and their effects on product sales. The analysis suggests that a model with TV and radio as predictors are the more suitable one while newspaper has negligible effects on the product sales
